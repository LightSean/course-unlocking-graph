# Kdam Tree Graph

Kdan Tree Graph is A little experiment using React.js with the Mateial-UI framework.
This application answers the question "After i will finish my course, what courses can i do?"

### Demo
[Demo on github pages](https://lightsean.github.io/course-unlocking-graph/)

Main packages and projects used:
  - [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
  - [react.js](https://reactjs.org/)
  - [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/)
  - [react-d3-tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-d3-tree)
  

### How it works?
I scraped the technion ug for all of the courses details. the courses data is saved in local raw data in the project.
All of the calculations are done in the client. 

### Planning for future
 - Extend the app to more fucntions other then course trees.
 - Do calculations on backend server and expose RESTful API so this app can consume
